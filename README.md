# Eagle Tracker Database

This project was created for the Georgia Tech Senior Capstone, American Bald Eagle Rehabilitation Tracker, by team Eagle Scouts. 
This webpage is specifically tailored for use by the American Eagle Foundation (AEF), and the webpages allows users to view the most recent locations of the trackers on a map and export the location history to an Excel spreadsheet.
